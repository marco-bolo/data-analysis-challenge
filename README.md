# The Marco-Bolo eDNA Data Analysis Challenge

The [EU Horizon MARCO-BOLO project](https://marcobolo-project.eu/) launched the eDNA Data Analysis Challenge, 
inviting the global eDNA community to download the provided datasets, 
run their pipeline on it, and submit their results for comparison across all participating pipelines and entries.

Information about the datasets, and instructions to participate can be found in the [participation page](https://github.com/marco-bolo/wp2-wp5-workshop/tree/main/)

Here, we present the entries and results of the eDNA data analyis challenge challenge.
